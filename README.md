#Polygon Numbers

##Description

This is a program to find the overlap in polygon-number roots.

For example:
	Square numbers: 1, 4, 9, 16,...
	Triangle numbers: 1, 3, 6,...

	But, the sixth square number is the same as 
	the eigth triangle number: 36, thus they overlap at 36.

	This program finds those overlaps.

##Building

* All you have to do to build this program is run `cargo build --release`, make sure you have cargo installed though.
