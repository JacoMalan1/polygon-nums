# Polygon Numbers

## Description

This is a program to find the overlap in polygon-number roots.

For example:
	Square numbers: 1, 4, 9, 16,...
	Triangle numbers: 1, 3, 6,...

	But, the sixth square number is the same as 
	the eigth triangle number: 36, thus they overlap at 36.

	This program finds those overlaps.

## Building

* First, you need to create the CMake build files. To do this, insure that you have CMake installed and run the following command in the root project directory: `cmake .`.
* Next, you need to tell CMake to build the program, To do this, simply run the following command: `cmake --build . --target all`.
* Finally, to run the program just run the newly-generated executable file called "shape_nums" or "shape_nums.exe" in a terminal or command prompt.
